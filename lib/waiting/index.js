// lib/waiting/index.js — WHAT A PERSON IS WAITING FOR, and noticing when it
// arrives.
//
// ── WHAT THIS REPLACES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The competitor's version is a Discord you join and a webhook that pings you.
// That is a NOTIFICATION PRODUCT: the person configures an alert, names a
// brand, sets a price ceiling, and maintains it forever.
//
// ASILUM already knows. A person searched for something and got nothing back —
// we logged it, with the query and the date. That is not an inference about
// their taste, it is a RECORD OF THEM ASKING. When inventory arrives that
// answers the question, the terminal says so.
//
// No alert to configure. No brand list to maintain. No channel to join.
// docs/INVISIBLE-MACHINERY.md.
//
// ── WHY AN EMPTY SEARCH IS THE ONLY HONEST SIGNAL ───────────────────────────
//
// ASTERISK may only reason from what it can point at (docs/HANDOVER.md §0).
// Consider the alternatives and why each is a guess:
//
//   a taste profile   says what you tend to like, NOT that you wanted a
//                     specific thing and could not have it
//   board saves       are things you found. A want is a thing you did not
//   dwell time        is attention, which is not desire
//
// An empty search is different in kind: the person typed the words, we
// answered "nothing", and both halves are in the log. When we can finally
// answer, telling them is not marketing — it is closing a loop they opened.
//
// ── AND IT IS THEIR OWN RECORD ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// First-party throughout. One person's searches, read to serve that same
// person, already visible to them in the §6 export, never aggregated across
// readers. The privacy-respecting version is also the only one with evidence
// behind it — which keeps being true and is worth noticing.

 *
 * THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS WAS WRONG and the numbers said so. It ranked the
 * pool by hand and kept anything scoring above a floor, which returned 170
 * "answers" for "black wool coat" — every one of them a `category browse`
 * fallback, none of them a match, and the top result a varsity jacket. The
 * real engine serves ZERO for that query. A hand-rolled matcher drifts from
 * search, and then a person is told their want was answered by a piece the
 * search page refuses to show them.
 *
 * `log: false` because replaying somebody's old query is not somebody
 * searching — see the option in lib/search/index.js.
 *
 * Returns [] on any failure. A weak match is worse than silence: it teaches a
 * person to ignore the thing.
