// lib/search/vocabulary.js — THE WORDS THE ENGINE KNOWS.
//
// Grammar words, garment nouns, and the stem indexes that let "sweaters" reach
// "sweater". Lifted out of lib/search/index.js, where they sat as ninety lines
// of table in the middle of the engine and answered the question a newcomer
// asks most often — "where does it decide that a trouser is bottoms?" — only
// to whoever scrolled past them.
//
// EVERY TABLE A RAW TOKEN INDEXES IS NULL-PROTOTYPE, and the two exported ones
// are read through an own-property check. This is not defensive style: a query
// word is not a property name, and "constructor jacket" once walked the
// prototype chain and set a constraint to a function. The `own` helper below
// is what stops it.
//
// Imported and RE-EXPORTED by lib/search/index.js, which stays the front door
// for everything outside this directory.
