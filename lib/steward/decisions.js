// lib/steward/decisions.js — what the steward may decide on its own.
//
// On 3 September 2026 the owner set the constitution's read-only rule aside
// for the steward and asked for a management agent that acts, runs on a
// schedule, and decides. This file is the DECISION half: a declared boundary,
// written down before any hand was built, so that "may the steward do X" is
// answered by reading a table rather than by reading the steward's mood.
//
// THREE TIERS, and an action is in exactly one:
//
//   delegated  the steward does it alone. Reversible, capped per run, ledgered
//              before it is made (schema-v50). The owner reads about it
//              afterwards, in the desk ledger or the run's own output.
//   confirm    the steward plans it and names it, and does it only when a
//              person says yes for THIS run (`--confirm=<id>` or the desk's
//              CONFIRM). Same ledger, same reversibility — the difference is
//              that the decision is a person's each time.
//   never      the steward reports it and stops. The `why` says which rail it
//              would cross. There is no flag that unlocks these.
//
// TWO RAILS THE OWNER'S WAIVER DID NOT MOVE, and nothing here crosses them:
//   * NO FAKING. A repair may hide a piece that cannot be shown honestly; it
//     may never invent the price that would let it be shown.
//   * A HARD STOP BEFORE ANYTHING IRREVERSIBLE. Deleting a source-of-truth
//     row, spending money, sending mail, changing who can get in. Those are
//     `never`, by name, below.
