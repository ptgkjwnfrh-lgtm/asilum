// lib/model/media.js — SAMPLE MEDIA for the Live Launch V.2 model.
//
// The repository ships no photographs (audited 17 Sep: public/ holds fonts
// and a road map; catalog covers are generated gradients), and the rights
// register blocks runway/editorial imagery. These eight files are the ONLY
// exception, and they are here because their licences allow it: seven
// Unsplash-licensed photographs and one CC BY 4.0 portrait, each credited in
// public/model/credits.json and on every surface that shows one.
//
// They illustrate SAMPLE editorial posts so The Wire and the Front Cover
// open on media before the first person posts. Every sample is labelled
// SAMPLE EDITORIAL on screen, is never a listing, never a price, never a
// person's account. When the media pipeline lands, real posts replace them
// in the same card.
