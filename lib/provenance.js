// lib/provenance.js — DOES ANYBODY BACK THIS, OR DID A SELLER SAY IT?
//
// Owner ruling, 27 August 2026, on Taobao and every marketplace like it:
// **ingest it, label it, do not hide it.** This module is that ruling as one
// function, so the answer cannot differ between two surfaces.
//
// THE THING BEING LABELLED IS NOT QUALITY. A marketplace piece is not worse
// than a merchant one — it is LESS KNOWN, and that is a different claim. A
// Taobao listing that says "Balenciaga" is a seller typing a word. A piece
// from a merchant we hold an agreement with is a name somebody stands behind.
// Both may be shown. Only one may be presented as fact.
//
// THIS IS ASTERISK'S FIRST LAW AT THE CATALOG BOUNDARY. ASTERISK may only
// reason from what it can point at, so a brand it cannot back is recorded as a
// CLAIM and never as a fact — see `brandIsClaim` below, which is what stops an
// unverified word being scored as though it were verified.
//
// VERIFICATION IS EARNED, SO THE DEFAULT IS "UNVERIFIED". An unrecognised
// source is not given the benefit of the doubt; a source only counts as backed
// when it appears in AUTHORIZED_SOURCES because a real agreement exists. That
// direction matters: the failure mode of guessing "verified" is telling a
// reader something is genuine when nobody checked.
//
// Client-safe: pure, no database, no imports beyond lib/url.

// ---- how much is riding on the claim? --------------------------------------
//
// OWNER RULING, 27 August 2026, and it is the sharper of the two:
//
//   "the avid consumer doesnt really care if its real if it looks cool at a
//    good price its being bought. if it is highly priced comparitivley to
//    construction, brand socially viewed value, matreial used, associated hype
//    then the verifcation is needed because multiple factors are at play for
//    my choice to buy it."
//
// So verification is not a constant worry — it scales with what is riding on
// it. At £20 a person is buying an OBJECT and the label is a footnote. At £900
// they are substantially buying a NAME, and the name is the part nobody
// checked. The signal should be quiet in the first case and unmissable in the
// second, and unverified stock is NEVER DEMOTED for it — the owner ruled that
// separately, and demotion is a soft form of hiding.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT YET KNOW, said plainly. The ruling says "highly priced
// COMPARATIVELY TO construction, brand value, material, hype". We cannot
// compute that today — it needs the comparables model
// (ROADMAP §4.6: same brand, garment, era and condition, drawn from our own
// history, and silent below n=3). Until that exists, absolute price is the
// honest proxy: it is a real number we hold, it moves the right way, and it
// does not pretend to be the comparison the owner actually described.
//
// When comparables land, `stakeOf` gains a second input and the thresholds
// below become the fallback for pieces with too few comparables to speak.
//
// These bands are deliberately NOT lib/tagging/dense.js `priceBand`. That one
// answers a search question ("show me things under 150"). This answers a
// different one — how much of this price rests on a word nobody verified — and
// the two must be free to move apart.

const STAKE_MATERIAL_AT = 150;   // above pocket-money: the claim starts to matter
const STAKE_HIGH_AT = 600;       // the name is now most of what is being bought

/** Nothing is riding on it: the source is backed, or it is not real stock. */
export const STAKE_NONE = "none";

 * and neither needs a warning: one is vouched for, the other is openly not for
 * sale.
 *
 * Price is read defensively. A missing or unreadable price returns
