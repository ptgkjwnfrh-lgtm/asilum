// D4's law (ruled 20 Aug 2026; spec docs/d4-consent-spec-2026-08-20.md):
// UNANSWERED = UNOBSERVED. The state rides an HttpOnly cookie the server
// reads on every observation write path; clients only ever ask
// /api/consent. Three states, two tiers of writes:
//
//   null (unanswered) → NOTHING persists: no impressions, no
//                       interaction-derived mutation, explicit included.
//   "general"         → the existing pause's parity: passive observation
//                       (dwell, impressions, serve memory) refused, while
//                       EXPLICIT acts (save, favorite, train) still teach —
//                       the settings copy has promised exactly that split
//                       since July ("the brain only learns from explicit
//                       actions").
//   "observe"         → everything.
