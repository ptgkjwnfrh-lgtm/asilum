// Three switches and the follow test the send path consults.
//
// setDmsOpen is not available to everyone: a passport may close its DMs, a
// BUSINESS may not. A shop that can be reached is the deal a business account
// takes; the refusal is a v40 trigger, and this layer surfaces its SQLSTATE
// rather than pre-checking the rule.
//
// Media consent is stored per participant and read on the export and render
// paths, so withdrawing it takes effect on the next read rather than needing
// anything to be rewritten.

 * the caller got a 409 while half of what they asked for stood. The refusal
 * body carried no state either, so the client could not learn which half.
 *
 * Two writes the caller made in one gesture are one act. Either both stand or

/**
 * The per-conversation "receive images and videos" toggle. BOTH sides hold

 *
 * THE STATE IS THE LATER OF THE TWO STAMPS, and neither one erases the other.
 *
 * The re-grant used to do `media_consent_at = COALESCE(media_consent_at,
 * now()), media_consent_revoked_at = NULL` — which kept the ORIGINAL grant
 * time and deleted the revocation outright. So a consent granted in March,
 * revoked in April and granted again in May read as "granted in March, never
 * revoked": the one question the two columns exist to answer — *was this
 * attachment sent under a consent that still stood?* — was answered wrongly,
 * and the schema comment and this docstring both claimed the opposite. Law 4
 * is the whole deliverable here, since OWNER-DECISIONS #3 ships the state and
 * no pipeline, and it was lossy.
 *
 * A grant now stamps a NEW grant, a revocation stamps a revocation, and
 * whichever is later is the answer. WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, stated so nobody
 * reads more into it: it keeps the latest grant and the latest revocation, not
 * every one of them. A full history needs an append-only table, and building
 * storage for a pipeline that does not exist is what the core cut on purpose —
 * `docs/dm-core-decisions-2026-08-23.md`. When attachments ship, that table
 * ships with them, and these two columns become its first two rows.
