 * route could only honour that on ONE path: first contact by handle, where it
 * happened to have resolved the other person already. Every send into an
 * existing conversation — which is every send after the first, and every send
 * from the thread view — and every reaction had nobody to ask about, so the
 * caller's own block collapsed to "this person is not reachable right now."
 *
 * That is the exact withholding the ambiguity rule was written to prevent,
 * aimed at the only person entitled to the answer, with the undo hidden. The
 * decliner is the ONLY person this product lets create a block, so they were
 * also the most likely person to hit it.

/**
 * Find people you can write to.
 *
 * THE SEARCH DOMAIN IS PUBLISHED PROFILE ROOMS, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE
 * ENUMERATION ANSWER. A DM search over "all accounts" turns the product into a
 * directory of everyone who ever signed up, and there is no rate limit that
 * makes that acceptable — it is the shape that is wrong, not the speed. Here,
 * appearing in a search result is something a person DID: they published a
 * room under a handle. Someone who never published is not hidden by a policy
 * that could be relaxed later; they are absent from the table this reads.
 *
 * Three exclusions here, and the reason each one is not optional:
 *   - MYSELF. A self-conversation is unrepresentable one layer down; offering
 *     it here would only produce a refusal.
 *   - ANYONE **I** HAVE BLOCKED. My own state, which I already know — hiding
 *     it tells me nothing I did not do myself.
 *   - HIDDEN OR UNDER-REVIEW ROOMS. The same for every caller, so absence
 *     carries no fact about the person asking. Moderation applies to discovery
 *     first.
 *
 * A CLOSED DOOR IS NO LONGER AN EXCLUSION EITHER, and that is a correction to
 * the ruling above rather than a new idea. Listing people who blocked me while
 * hiding people whose door is shut made the pair readable: present in search
 * AND refused on send could only mean a block, because a shut door would have
 * removed them from the search. The refusal collapses P0001 and P0002 on
 * purpose; the two surfaces have to agree for that collapse to be worth
 * anything, and it was the search that disagreed.
 *
 * The cost, stated: a search result you cannot write to. Their room is a public
 * page either way, so nothing is revealed that was not already published — and
 * the alternative is a collapse that only looks like one.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* EXCLUDED: SOMEONE WHO BLOCKED **ME**.
 *
 * It used to be, and that made search a block detector. Absence was
 * caller-specific, so a harasser could search a handle from their own account
 * and from a throwaway and compare: present there, gone here, therefore the
 * block landed. For a business it took no second account at all — a business
 * cannot close its door, so vanishing could only mean a block. Detecting the
 * block is the whole cost driver in ban evasion: someone who cannot tell
 * whether it landed wastes effort, and someone who gets a definitive read
 * re-registers immediately.
 *
 * That defeated the ambiguity built one file over on purpose (lib/dm.js:
 * P0001 and P0002 collapse "they blocked you" and "their door is shut" into
 * one sentence "precisely because distinguishing them tells a stranger which
 * one it was"). I wrote that rule and then broke it here three PRs later.
 *
 * Listing them costs nothing, because the exclusion never enforced anything:
 * a profile room IS a public page, so the handle was already visible; and
 * `resolveAddressee` below KEEPS the bidirectional predicate, so addressing
 * them still fails — with the same collapsed refusal, from the same branch,
 * as a closed door or a handle that never existed. Nothing is created; there
 * is no thread, no request, no notification. The searcher learns exactly what
 * they learn about everyone they cannot write to: nothing.
 *
 * Ruling made 23 Aug under the owner's autonomy window and recorded in
 * docs/dm-core-decisions-2026-08-23.md. To reverse it, restore the second arm
 * of the NOT EXISTS below — and re-read that note first, because the reversal
 * restores the oracle.
