// ---- §6 export (the access right) -------------------------------------------
//
// CONSTITUTION.md §6 requires every signal to expose
// "edit/disconnect/forget/export/delete controls". Delete has existed since
// purgePersonalizationData; EXPORT did not, so a user could erase their data
// but never see it. This is that control.
//
// THE CONTRACT IS SYMMETRY WITH ERASURE: what we delete is what we show you.
// Anything purgePersonalizationData removes must appear here, and anything it
// deliberately RETAINS must be named rather than silently missing. The
// manifest below is that promise in machine-checkable form, and
// tests/privacy-export.test.js asserts purge's DELETE list is a subset of it —
// so a future table added to erasure and forgotten here fails a test instead
// of quietly narrowing the user's access right.
//
// §6 also forbids silent caps, so every bounded read reports `truncated` and
// the `cap` it hit rather than returning a short list that looks complete.
// WHAT ERASURE LEAVES BEHIND, in one place because three call sites returned
// it as a literal and the mem branch had already drifted from the Postgres one
// once — telling people on preview deploys a different retention from the one
// production performs.
//
// DIRECT MESSAGES ARE NAMED HERE because the 23 Aug review found erasure and
// export did not know the subsystem existed: no dm_* table was deleted, none
// was exported, and the retention disclosure did not mention them either.
// Silence read as "erased".
//
// They are now EXPORTED (owner ruling: two people should have records) and
// still RETAINED, and those two facts are not in tension — they are the same
// fact seen from both ends. A message is also the OTHER person's record of a
// conversation they took part in: deleting one side's copy destroys somebody
// else's history, and handing one side a copy destroys nothing. So the export
// gives it to you and erasure leaves it alone, and this list says so rather
// than letting you infer it.

// OWNER RULING, 23 August: **two people should have records.** #395 left one
// question open — whether a DM export ships at all, given that a conversation
// is two people's record and one side asking for a copy is asking for words
// the other side wrote. The answer is that both sides are IN it, so both sides
// get it. A person's own conversation is theirs to keep; the alternative is a

//

// "erased AND exported", and E2 enforces the second half of that biconditional
// — a manifest table that erasure never touches fails the test, because until
// now such a table could only be a mistake. A two-party record is the first
// thing that is genuinely EXPORTED AND RETAINED: erasing it would delete
// somebody else's history of a conversation they were in.
//
// So the asymmetry gets its own name rather than a hole in E2. Every dm_*
