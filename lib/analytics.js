// SERVER ONLY — reads the database directly.
//
// The rule the handover set: "read-only, real counters, no invented
// metrics." So every number here is a count of rows that exist, each one
// carries the exact window it was measured over, and nothing is modelled,
// smoothed, projected, or filled in. Where a number cannot be computed,
// this returns null and the page says so rather than drawing a zero.
//
// It also means these are DESCRIPTIONS, not judgments: "returning
// identities" counts identities seen in two consecutive weeks, which is
// not the same as people (one person can hold a device identity and an
// account) and the label says so on the page. A metric that quietly means
// something other than its name is the fabricated number in another coat.
