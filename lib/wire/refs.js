// lib/wire/refs.js
// Hashtags and @mentions on the wire (owner directive,
// HANDOVER-2026-08-14 backlog 3). Pure text in, structure out — no DOM,
// no db, no window: safe to import from routes, tests, and components
// alike.
//
// ORDER MATTERS, and the handover names it: parse AFTER the sanitizer,
// never before. sanitizeStatement strips angle brackets and control
// characters; parsing first would hand the renderer spans built from
// text the sanitizer had not yet cleaned. Everything here therefore
// takes already-sanitized text and only ever SPLITS it — no segment is
// rewritten, so what a reader sees is exactly what the author wrote.

// handles.js, NOT rooms.js: rooms reaches the database, and this module
// is imported by a client component (importing rooms would ship `pg` to
// the browser and break the build).
