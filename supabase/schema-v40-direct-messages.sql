--
-- Direct messages between two SIGNED-IN accounts. Text only: OWNER-DECISIONS
-- #3 keeps the media pipeline switched off until a CSAM provider, a designated
-- DMCA agent and named moderators exist, so no attachment table is created —
-- the consent STATE ships here, the pipeline does not.
--
-- Rationale and the full cut list: docs/dm-core-decisions-2026-08-23.md.
-- Keys are the bare auth uuid (ADR-002). Device identities cannot hold a row.
--
-- WHY THE LAWS ARE TRIGGERS AND NOT APPLICATION CHECKS. The route is not the
-- only writer: the admin desk, a migration and any future job write too. A law
-- that lives in one caller is a convention, and v38 is the local proof that a
-- convention silently fails.
