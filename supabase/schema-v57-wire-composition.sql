-- THE ONE WIRE COMPOSER (V.2 brief §6, owner, 1 Oct 2026). A transmission
-- is no longer only text with a title: it has a KIND (transmission | post |
-- video), a LAYOUT when it is a post (single | carousel | fragment | expose
-- | event) and ATTACHMENTS — images in the "wire" bucket, tagged pieces
-- (snapshots of resolved listings), one event (a snapshot of the map's
-- record), one link (a plain-text preview snapshot), the exposé's text
-- layers as structured text with normalised positions (never a flattened
-- picture), and an author-written alt. Legacy rows read as `transmission`
-- (or `post` where image_url was set — the read path decides).
--
-- Numbered 57: v54/v55 are Codex's on its open branches; v56 is the eBay
-- feed publication on market/ebay-bulk-feed.

-- ROLLBACK: ALTER TABLE editorial_posts DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS post_kind,
-- DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS layout, DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS attachments;
-- DELETE FROM app_schema_migrations WHERE version = 57;
