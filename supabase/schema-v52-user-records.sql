-- THE DEVICE RECORDS BECOME REAL (V.2, 19 Sep 2026).
--
-- Live Launch V.2 kept four kinds of record on the device alone and said so
-- on screen: saves of people / places / events / articles (asilum-saves),
-- the reader's base city and its visibility (asilum-location), corrections
-- to an overview or a place (asilum-corrections) and studio drafts
-- (asilum-studio-drafts). The owner's word for V.2 is "everything real":
-- a record that lives in one browser is not a record. This table holds all
-- four as the SAME JSON the client already writes, keyed by the identity
-- every other per-person table uses, so adoption on sign-in, erasure and
-- export reach them like everything else (AGENTS.md § Identity).
--
-- One table, not four. The rows differ in `kind`; the laws (identity,
-- adoption, purge, export, caps) are identical, and four copies of the same
-- law drift — the lib/db split of 6 Sep found exactly that.
--
--   user_records   (user_id, kind, record_id) is the key. `payload` is the
--                  client's record as written; the app caps it at 8 KiB and
--                  never reads instructions out of it. `location` has one
--                  row per person (record_id 'base'); the coordinates in it
--                  are PRIVATE and the route serves them only to their owner.
--
-- Also in this version: user_corrections gains the two columns reason-
-- specific learning needs — `scope` (this item / this session / ongoing) and
-- `undone_at` (an undo is a stamp, not a delete; the row stays as evidence
-- that the correction was made and taken back).
--
-- ROLLBACK: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_records; ALTER TABLE user_corrections
-- DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS scope, DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS undone_at;
-- DELETE FROM app_schema_migrations WHERE version = 52;
