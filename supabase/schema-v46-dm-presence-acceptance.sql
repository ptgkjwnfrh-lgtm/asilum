-- PRESENCE NEEDS AN ACCEPTED CONVERSATION.
--
-- v42 refused reactions on an unaccepted conversation, and said why: "a
-- reaction on an unaccepted request is a notification a stranger can send".
-- The same reasoning was never applied to the typing channel, which v41 had
-- shipped one migration earlier — so a stranger's knock carried a live
-- presence channel with it. That is trap 92 again, in the same subsystem it
-- was written about: WHEN A LAW GAINS A NEW ENFORCEMENT POINT, EVERY SURFACE
-- OLDER THAN THAT LAW HAS TO BE RE-CHECKED. v44 carried the BLOCK predicate
-- back to typing and stopped there; the ACCEPTANCE predicate was the other
-- half of the same omission.
--
-- The read side is worse than the write side and is fixed in lib/db/dm.js
-- alongside this: `peerActivity` returned the recipient's read position on a
-- REQUEST. Opening a knock to see who it was told the sender a real human had
-- opened it — the tracking-pixel confirmation that separates a live address
-- from a dead one, which is exactly what a stranger sending unsolicited mail
-- wants to learn. No trigger can stop a read; only the query can.
--
-- Serious findings of docs/dm-open-findings-2026-08-23.md.
--
-- P0003 is the code v42 uses for "this needs an accepted conversation", and
-- the same one v40 uses for the one-knock law. The refusal is a state, not a
-- fact about a person, so it does not need the collapsing lib/dm.js applies to
-- P0001/P0002.
