-- LIKES + SAVES on transmissions (owner directive, HANDOVER-2026-08-14
-- backlog 2). The handover's law: "person-deduped counters in the
-- popularity style (engagers, not events). NO fabricated numbers, ever."
--
-- One row per (transmission, person, kind). The primary key IS the
-- dedupe: liking twice, from ten tabs, or in a loop writes ONE row and
-- therefore counts ONE person — the v22/v23 anti-manipulation law
-- (repetition buys nothing; only another human moves a counter).
--
-- The person is identified by identity_hash = sha256(uid), the
-- unknown_query_votes / edge_contributors / popularity_contributors
-- precedent: pseudonymous in the table, still personal data, so it is
-- reached by BOTH movers of identity — purgePersonalizationData deletes
-- it and adoptAccountData rekeys it (device hash → account hash,
-- ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING so one signed-in human never counts twice).
-- That is the identity-coverage law: a new per-identity table joins both
-- functions or is deliberately excluded with a reason.
--
-- NO denormalized counter column exists on purpose. popularity carries
-- materialized counts because it ranks the whole catalog; the wire reads
-- at most a page of transmissions, so the counts are computed on read
-- and CANNOT drift from the ledger. A count that can disagree with its
-- evidence is exactly the fabricated number the constitution forbids.
--
-- ON DELETE CASCADE: the author's own delete is SOFT (the transmission
-- keeps its engagements, and its record), but the privacy purge HARD
-- deletes editorial_posts — when a person erases their account, the
-- likes on their transmissions must go with them, not dangle.
--
-- Rollback: DROP TABLE transmission_engagements;
