-- schema-v47-dm-unsend-locks-what-it-checks.sql
--
-- A GUARD THAT DOES NOT LOCK WHAT IT CHECKED HAS ONLY CHECKED THE PAST.
--
-- dm_guard_reaction refuses a reaction on an unsent message by reading the row
-- with a plain SELECT. A plain SELECT takes no lock, so between that read and
-- the reaction's COMMIT the message can be unsent by someone else — and it
-- was: the reaction survived on a tombstone, permanently, visible to the
-- author of the message they had just withdrawn, removable only by the person
-- who left it.
--
-- SELECT ... FOR SHARE takes a row-level share lock, which is exactly the
-- statement of intent this guard needs: *this row must not change underneath
-- me before I commit*. The unsend's UPDATE needs an exclusive lock on the same
-- row, so it now waits for the reaction to land and then removes it in the
-- same transaction (lib/db/dm.js, this PR). The two orderings that used to
-- produce an orphan produce the same clean end state instead.
--
-- Serious finding of docs/dm-open-findings-2026-08-23.md. It is the same
-- lesson as v40's idempotency ordering, one table over: the ordering of a
-- check against the write it guards IS the law, not an implementation detail.
--
-- Nothing else in the function changes. It is recreated whole because that is
-- how this schema does it — a function is replaced, never patched.
