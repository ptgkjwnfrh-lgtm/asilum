// WHY THIS EXISTS. §"Deferred with a measurement, not a shrug" in the 16 August
// handover is the good kind of deferral: each item carries the number that made
// it not-worth-doing and the condition that would change the answer. What it
// did not carry is a way to CHECK those conditions. So the 17 August handover
// repeated "neither has triggered" while its own State section admitted the
// figures were "not re-measured today, carried from 16 August" — which is a
// claim about production made from a two-day-old reading. Both statements were
// true and neither was verified. That is the gap this closes.
//
// On 17 August the live answer was: largest board 6 items (unchanged), 915
// items against the 5,000 cap. Neither fired. The point is that the next
// session gets that answer in ten seconds instead of inheriting it.
//
// Exit 0 = nothing has triggered, or no database is configured.
// Exit 1 = at least one deferred item is now worth doing.

// Each trigger names where its threshold came from. The distinction matters:
// an INHERITED threshold was measured and written down by the audit that
// deferred the work, and should not be moved without redoing that measurement.
// A CHOSEN one is this script's own reading of a vague condition, and is the
// one to argue with.
