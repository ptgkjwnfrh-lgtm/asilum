# V.2 integration contracts, proposal v0.1

Status: proposed by Codex, September 19, 2026; Claude acknowledgement pending. This file defines information and behavior, not a mandate to create duplicate routes. Adapt existing endpoints additively where possible. Preserve current clients until both sides have migrated. Claude supplies server adapters and validators; Codex supplies client adapters and presentation. Resolve names in the coordination issue.

## Common behavior

Return a version, request ID, and typed outcome. Distinguish successful empty results from unavailable services, unauthorized access, validation failure, stale cursor, and rate limits. Preserve appropriate HTTP status codes. Suggested error shape: `{error:{code,message,retryable},requestId}`. Do not return internal traces, secrets, raw body measurements, private messages, or full user history in public diagnostics. Server time is authoritative; UI optimistic state is pending until acknowledged.

## Search and overview DTOs

```ts
type Source = {
  id: string; url: string; publisher: string;
  retrievedAt: string; revisionId?: number; revisionTimestamp?: string;
  articleUrl?: string; revisionUrl?: string; historyUrl?: string;
  license?: string; licenseUrl?: string;
};
type Claim = { text: string; sourceIds: string[] };
type Entity = {
  id: string; kind: 'designer' | 'house'; name: string; aliases: string[];
  wikidataQid: string | null;
  overviewStatus: 'matched' | 'language_only' | 'ambiguous' | 'no_article' | 'wikidata_only' | 'temporary_failure' | string;
  overview: {
    paragraph: string; language: string; languageLabel: string;
    pageId: number; title: string; revisionId: number; revisionTimestamp: string;
    selector: string; extractorVersion: string; contentHash: string;
    editorialModifications: string[]; fetchedAt: string; checkedAt: string; expiresAt: string;
  } | null;
  image: { url: string; alt: string; credit: string; rights: string; sourceUrl: string; modifications: string[] } | null;
  sources: Source[];
  // House founder, country, founding year and design language are sourced claims.
  facts: { key: string; claim: Claim }[];
};
type CareerEdge = {
  id: string; designerId: string; houseId: string; role: string;
  start: string | null; end: string | null;
  datePrecision: 'day' | 'month' | 'year' | 'unknown';
  sourceIds: string[]; sourceCatalog: Source[];
  queryText: string; // e.g. TOM FORD: GUCCI, safe to encode into ?q=
  matchingItemCount: number | null;
};
type SearchPage = {
  contractVersion: 1; requestId: string;
  query: { text: string; designerId?: string; houseId?: string };
  // Reuse the existing interpreted constraints and product DTOs via adapters.
  interpreted: unknown; results: ExistingProductDTO[];
  overview: Entity | null; related: CareerEdge[];
  nextCursor: string | null; snapshotId: string;
  total: number | null; totalIsExact: boolean;
  candidatesTruncated: boolean;
};
```

These illustrative TypeScript names are not imports or implemented declarations. Actual fixtures must validate against the agreed runtime schema. An overview is nullable when a relevant, revision-consistent Wikipedia paragraph is missing. Return the complete stored paragraph; Codex clamps to four visual lines and owns expansion. Text and image licenses are independent. Career edges are independent of item availability and sort by known start date, with a deterministic unknown-date policy. Separate historical house names/aliases from canonical IDs. Never manufacture garment attribution from a career date alone.

For pair queries, return both canonical entities/IDs so quick selections and headings cannot disagree. Existing product cards remain the item contract; add minimal explicit designer attribution/provenance metadata rather than replacing the entire DTO. Apply current explicit constraints to every returned carousel, including exploration. A designer's complete career registry and an inventory-backed quick filter are different concepts and both must be identifiable.

## Learning events

Extend the existing event path rather than making a second analytics store. Suggested fields: `eventId`, authenticated subject resolved on server, `impressionId`, `itemId`, `contextId`, `action`, `reason`, `scope`, `occurredAt`, `policyVersion`, `undoOf`. Reasons include price, fit, finish, silhouette, wrong attribution, and not interested; scope distinguishes this item/session/ongoing preference. Validate reason/action compatibility and deduplicate retries.

Recommendation responses can add `reasonCodes`, `evidenceRefs`, `confidenceBand`, and `policyVersion`. These fields explain the selection without exposing raw internal reasoning. Private evidence references must never resolve through another user's request. Preserve existing explicit-vs-inferred memory boundaries and erasure/adoption behavior.

## Fit

Keep the current fitAssessment fields through an adapter. Add a typed evidence result: `unknown | estimated | measured`, supported dimension comparisons, `missingDimensions`, relevant source references, and a confidence band. Null never becomes zero. A measurement value includes unit, body/garment/chart origin, flat/circumference method, and evidence. “Measured” identifies evidence quality, not guaranteed fit. Client text must not promise more than the backend compared.

## DM

Retain current routes and operation names. Return stable message ID, thread ID, server sequence/timestamp, client retry ID, cursor, and authoritative delivery/request status where supported. Identity is derived from the session, never a client-supplied user ID. A retry cannot create a second message. Cursor tie-breakers must handle identical timestamps. Block/consent changes are rechecked at write time. Codex maps pending/sent/failed states and paginates the durable thread; realtime only prompts reconciliation.

## Purchase hub

Provide a read facade that returns stable record IDs, `kind: payment_order | source_ticket`, merchant, item/variant, currency, separate payment/fee/merchant/outcome state, source of the outcome, timestamps, and allowed next actions. Existing state machines stay authoritative. An unavailable provider does not convert a pending order to paid, cancelled, or refunded. Amounts remain integer minor units. Actions validate current ownership and server state; a UI button cannot authorize a refund or purchase by itself.

Provider confirmation, user report, and unknown must remain separate. Never count a saved bag or paid ASILUM fee as a verified garment purchase. Handle partial/cross-lane outcomes explicitly. Claude proposes the smallest existing-route extension and a representative fixture for each state; Codex renders it without guessing.

## Map, uploads, and connections

Return consent-scoped user locations, sourced store/event coordinates, stable IDs, display names, validity windows, and pagination/viewport bounds. No private coordinates in anonymous responses. Upload responses identify durable vs device-only persistence, authorization, processing state, and failure. Connection responses identify the actual provider, granted capabilities, expiry/disconnection state, and availability. A configured client button is not a connected account.

## Contract acceptance cases

- `TOM FORD: GUCCI` resolves both entities and cannot return unrelated Gucci or unrelated Tom Ford stock.
- A designer's verified house stays listed at zero inventory; a house's designers sort by dated relationships, not item counts.
- No new stock or rank update creates duplicate/omitted items within one valid search snapshot.
- Missing measurements survive normalize/display/save as missing; chart estimates cannot self-label as measured.
- Search/provider failure is distinguishable from zero results.
- DM retry, block race, and nonparticipant access have tested outcomes.
- A fee payment and merchant garment purchase cannot share a misleading “purchased” state.
- New data tables and event fields participate in authorized export/deletion and identity adoption.

Claude should post the actual exported types, endpoint mappings, state fixtures, test evidence, and any required amendments in the coordination issue. Codex then confirms integration against those exact contracts.
