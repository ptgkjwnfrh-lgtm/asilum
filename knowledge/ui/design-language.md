# Design language — Fashion Intelligence OS

ASILUM is not an e-commerce site, a Pinterest clone, or a SaaS dashboard.
It is a **fashion intelligence operating system**: an alternate 1998–2005
future where OS, instrument, passport, and magazine evolved together. The
user navigates a living archive; the interface visibly studies them back.

Reference constellation (interaction principles, never assets): Winamp,
IBM AudioStation, early Xbox dashboard, PS2-era system software, Resident
Evil status screens, passports/visa security printing, GPS/military
navigation, medical monitors, ambient-electronica sleeve design (Aphex
Twin, Gen X Soft Club), early-2000s video tooling. Gen X Soft Club softens
the machine: curves, haze, milky glass — atmosphere over nostalgia.

## Law
- Information density over whitespace; dividers, labels, metadata,
  timestamps ARE the decoration. Every character of text is a real datum.
- RED (--red) is the only accent voice: activity, alert, recording,
  selection, the ASTERISK identity. No second accent, ever.
- Palettes (tokens in globals.css): phosphor dark NATIVE (blacks, phosphor
  greens, purple, red) / ice light (near-white blue-green, teal, red).
  Legacy token names (--ink/--paper/--line/--grey/--faint) carry OS values.
- Layered depth: backlight → grid → haze blobs → content → glow →
  scanline glass. Subtlety threshold: never reduce readability.
- Seven destinations, permanent left anchor (owner amendment July 25 —
  FRONT COVER added as the landing edition): FRONT COVER, CATALOG,
  EDITORIAL, PASSPORT, DISCOVER, PROFILE, SETTINGS. New features must
  answer "which subsystem do I belong to?" — the destination list only
  changes by owner decree.
- Two user-switchable interfaces (Settings → Appearance, localStorage
  asilum-model): 01 MODULE RAIL (instrument stack) / 02 ORB HUB (engine
  front and centre, lozenge nav, [data-model="02"] variants). Structure
  changes; palette follows the theme system.

## Passport UV page (redesign/passport-uv, owner inspo: Swiss passport under UV)
The PASSPORT document on /board renders as a page under blacklight —
`app/components/PassportSecurity.jsx` + the `.ppuv/.ppterrain/.pv*` layer in
globals.css. Header: registration crosses, plus-pattern ridge, "01" numeral
(hidden ≤760px), nation line "ASILUM MAGAZINE * FASHION PASSPORT" (doubled glow), trilingual
type "PASSPORT · パスポート · PASSEPORT" above the photo, *ASILUM microprint.
Hologram (owner iteration 5): REAL PARIS — actual OpenStreetMap road
geometry rendered full-bleed across the document. Data pipeline:
scripts/fetch-paris-roads.py → public/paris-roads.json (~525 KiB; © OSM
contributors ODbL — credit rendered in the map window). Layers: major
roads 14 km radius, secondary 14 km, full street core 4.6 km, building
footprints 1.2 km as very thin NON-glowing outlines. Every road traced as
a line; NO street names. 215 red text-style asterisks mark intersections
where >= 5 road arms genuinely meet, computed from the road graph
(junction clustering collapses roundabout plazas like l'Étoile to one
star). Two masked copies (.ppholo): over the data page glow-FREE at ~0.13
opacity; the lower window full opacity + heavy glow. Document proportions
lock to a U.S. passport data page (aspect 125/88 ≥900px): photo 148×186
centred on the left edge under a four-language stack (PASSPORT /
パスポート / REISEPASS / PASSEPORT), three-column field grid; the MRZ sits ON THE DIVIDER between the data page and the map window (dashed above+below), microprint at the very bottom edge. Re-run the fetch script to refresh the
map; the component only reads the JSON. Data page is U.S.-style and REAL only: username from
the bearer's profile, TASTE CLASS = ASTERISK's one-word read of the
conviction weights (lib/brain/taste-class.js — 12 classes: DARK, STREET,
ACTIVE, PREPPY, PROFESSIONAL, MINIMALIST, ROMANTIC, AVANT, ARCHIVIST,
UNDERGROUND, TECHNICAL, OPULENT; UNCLASSIFIED when no signal), SEX X (never collected — never invent), COUNTRY OF
ORIGIN = device locale region, MEMBER SINCE stamped once locally
(asilum-member-since, local-time anchored), ACCOUNT NO = the database uid,
which the TD3 machine zone also encodes (document + personal number
fields); summit marker = top conviction. MRZ data runs glow green,
chevron filler red; MRZ scrollbar hidden but scrollable.
