// crossed the boundary between the module that PRODUCES a value and the module
// that LABELS it.

// The ALPHA table always carried correct "2XL" / "3XL" / "ONE SIZE" rows. They
// were unreachable: every lookup key was built by stripping the label, so
// "2XL" became "XL" and "ONE SIZE" became "ONESIZE", and a `!numMatch` guard
// then refused the lookup for anything containing a digit. The digit fell
// through to the NUMERIC path and was read as a body measurement.
