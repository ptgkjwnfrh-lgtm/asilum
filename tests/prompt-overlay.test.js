// tests/prompt-overlay.test.js — audit finding #9, verified in
// docs/audit-verified-2026-08-14.md.
//
// /?q=<prompt> is the search hand-off, and app/page.js tells the user exactly
// what it means: "Asterisk is routing this edit toward X without rewriting your
// Passport". Both halves of that sentence were false, in opposite directions:
//
//   a user WITH taste — q was read, clamped to 400 chars, and then never used
//                       by anything. No routing happened at all.
//   a COLD user       — q was seeded through coldStart into `profile`, which is
//                       the object /api/feed persists. The Passport rewrite the
//                       notice disclaims is the one thing it did.
//
// A prompt is now an ephemeral overlay on one serve, exactly like a craving:
// read by the ranker, stored by nothing. /api/train stays the only path that
// persists a prompt, on the user's explicit action.
//
// The route itself cannot be invoked here (next/server does not resolve outside
// the bundler), so the ranking claims are made against buildFeed with the exact
// arguments the route now passes, and the persistence claim is pinned
// structurally at the bottom.
