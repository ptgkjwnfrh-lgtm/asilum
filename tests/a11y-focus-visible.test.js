// tests/a11y-focus-visible.test.js — nothing may remove focus without replacing it.
//
// WCAG 2.4.7 (Focus Visible, Level AA) requires a visible indication of which
// control has keyboard focus. `outline: none` removes the browser's default one.
// That is legitimate — this design replaces it with a border-colour shift to
// `--sig`, the interaction voice — but only when a replacement actually exists.
//
// The claims register found four that had none: `.search` (the top-bar search),
// `.controls input[type='text']` (the passport trainer and new-board field),
// `.usearch input` (people search) and `.composer2 textarea` (the transmission
// composer). Each set `outline: none` in its base rule and defined no `:focus`
// style anywhere, so a keyboard user tabbing through them saw nothing at all
// while the `/accessibility` page claimed "visible focus".
//
// This is a static check on `globals.css`. It cannot judge whether an indicator
// is strong enough — only that suppressing the default is always paired with
// putting something back.
