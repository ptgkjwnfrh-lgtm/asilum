// tests/account-kinds.test.js — the split between a passport and a business.
//
// The kind re-shapes navigation, six routes, the profile layout and the DM
// rules. The danger in a split like this is not that one branch is wrong — it
// is that two branches DISAGREE: a nav that hides a link while the route stays
// reachable is not a hidden feature, it is an unguarded one. So these tests
// pin the capability table as the single answer, and pin that the guard reads
// the same table the nav does.
