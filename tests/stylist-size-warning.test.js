// `String(it.size)` against the user's size preferences. EVERY catalog item
// carries `size` as an OBJECT —
//   {label, system, gender, fitsLikeUS, runsBias, measurements}
// so String(it.size) was the literal "[object Object]", which is never in a
// preferences list. Every sized piece in every look was warned "size may not
// match preference", including exact matches.
//
// Not a rare path: app/api/outfits passes sizePreferences straight from the
// user's own fit profile, so anyone who set their size got a wall of false
// warnings — and the list is .slice(0,4)'d, so real availability warnings were
// pushed out by the noise.
