// tests/piece-url.test.js — the stable piece URL, and the two rules it obeys.
//
// `/piece/<id>` exists to solve one problem: a shared piece link previewed as
// the generic site card, because `/?item=<id>` is a query parameter on a CLIENT
// component and a client component cannot export `generateMetadata`. Option (a)
// of the ruling in docs/seo-notes.md, chosen by the owner.
//
// Two constraints make this route unusual, and both are easy to undo by
// accident:
//
//   RULE 8 (owner decree, asilum-ui): "item depth belongs to the item modal."
//   This page carries metadata and hands off. The moment someone renders price,
//   tags, favourite/bag controls or related pieces here, the decree is broken
//   and there are two places item depth lives.
//
//   noindex WITHOUT a robots.txt disallow. Those are different jobs. noindex
//   keeps a synthetic product out of search results; leaving the path crawlable
//   is what lets a social scraper FETCH the page and read the card. Disallowing
//   it would break the exact preview this route was built to fix.
