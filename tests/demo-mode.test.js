// tests/demo-mode.test.js — the owner's Aug-16 ruling, made executable.
//
// The catalog is synthetic sample data. It was shown with prices, sizes,
// seasons, availability and "just in", and every record offered a Buy control
// that /api/tickets would refuse with a 409 — so a visitor learned the truth
// by clicking. Demo mode labels the records and removes the control.
//
// THE ONE THING THAT MUST NOT DRIFT is the definition of "demo". The client
// hides Buy using isDemoItem(); the server refuses tickets using its own rule
// in app/api/tickets/route.js. If those two ever disagree, one of two bugs
// appears: a Buy button that always fails (the bug just fixed), or — worse — a
// real listing quietly labelled DEMO and unbuyable. The parity test below is
// the guard, and it runs against the REAL catalog rather than a fixture.
