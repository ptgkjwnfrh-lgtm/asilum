// lib/db/production.js was 4,502 lines and came apart into lib/db/production/*.
// One line inside the §6 export did `await import("./dm.js")` — correct while
// the code lived in lib/db/, wrong the moment it moved one directory down. The
// build reported it as a WARNING that scrolls past, the unit suite was green,
// and the failure mode in production would have been an access-right export
// telling a person their mail desk was "unreadable".
//
// A static import would have thrown at load. A dynamic one inside a try/catch
// is invisible to every check the repo had. So the check is now here: every
// relative specifier in lib/db, static or dynamic, must name a file that
// exists. It costs nothing and it does not depend on a database.
