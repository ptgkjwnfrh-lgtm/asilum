// Round A. adoptAccountData's two backends disagreed about the one thing
// processed_operations exists for: whether a REPLAYED interaction batch is
// safe across sign-in.
//
//   Postgres : INSERT ... SELECT rekeys the device's operation ids to the
//              account, THEN deletes the originals -> a replay is refused.
//   mem      : deleted them outright -> a replay was ACCEPTED and applied
//              a second time.
//
// MEASURED before the fix: eng/imp reached 2 for a single replayed batch, plus
// a duplicate interaction row and a duplicate event. `engagers` stayed correct
// only because the v22/v23 ledgers dedupe downstream — a different mechanism
// masking part of the damage, which is why this was invisible.
//
// Adoption is exactly when a client is most likely to retry: shell.js re-issues
// writes around the sign-in identity swap. mem mode is what preview deploys,
// local dev, and nearly every test run on — so the broken half was the half
// actually being exercised. The Postgres counterpart of this test lives in
// tests/postgres-integration.test.js so the two backends are pinned to the
// SAME answer rather than each to its own.
