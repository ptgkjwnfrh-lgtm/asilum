// "mem and Postgres are one system with two implementations, and mem is
// the one being exercised." (HANDOVER-2026-08-08.) Preview deploys, local
// dev, and 520 of 532 tests run mem, so a divergence ships green. These
// pin the two divergences confirmed by the Aug 14 verification pass, in
// the backend that would otherwise hide them.
//
// Both tests fail against the code as it stood before the fix — checked
// by reverting each fix and watching them go red (law 2).

// NOTE — where the OTHER confirmed divergence is tested, and why not here.
// A non-numeric ticketId (purchase_tickets.id is BIGSERIAL) used to raise
// Postgres 22P02 → 500 while mem answered a clean 400. A mem test cannot
// catch that: mem's Number("abc") → NaN misses either way, so the
// assertion passes with the fix AND without it — the exact anti-pattern
// law 2 names ("a test asserting the benign case passes against the
// bug"). I wrote it here first, reverted the fix, watched it stay green,
// and moved it to tests/postgres-integration.test.js, where the
// unguarded query really does raise and the guard really can fail.
