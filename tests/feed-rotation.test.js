// WHAT A HEAVY SCROLLER CAN REACH.
//
// `_meta.seen` is feed rotation memory. It was capped at a flat 200, and the
// debt register described the consequence as "past ~200 pieces served, the
// oldest fall out and can reappear — a heavy scroller loops". That was true
// and much too mild: measured (npm run feed:rotation), the reader was confined
// to 286 of 915 items PERMANENTLY, and never shown the other two thirds
// however long they scrolled.
//
// The cause is that the memory is a score penalty rather than an exclusion, so
// it saturates: 200 penalised items, serve the next best 60, those enter
// memory, 60 fall out with their penalty lifted, and the feed oscillates over
// one taste-shaped neighbourhood forever. Reach scaled almost linearly with
// the cap — 200 -> 286, 400 -> 482, 800 -> 864, 1000 -> all 915 — which is
// what makes it a SIZE rather than a threshold.
//
// The cap is now passed by the caller from the pool it served. This test is
// the guard on that, and it asserts the shape rather than the tuning:
//
//   1. sized to the pool, a reader reaches ALL of it;
//   2. under-sized, they do not — so assertion 1 cannot be passing because the
//      pool is small or the engine is uniform;
//   3. the memory is de-duped, because an id held twice is a slot spent
//      remembering the same piece twice.
