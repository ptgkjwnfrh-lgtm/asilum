// audit #20: write surfaces (interaction, boards, interpret-feedback) had no
// global circuit breaker, so accumulated device identities could run up
// unbounded DB cost while reads failed closed at their budgets. The write
// scopes now carry default budgets, and consumeGlobalBudget accepts a cost so
// a batched interaction draws in proportion to its load.
//
// NOTE the limiter is process-global with a per-minute window, so each real
// scope is touched ONCE (proving its budget exists) and the mechanics are
// tested on unique private scopes that no other test shares — the same
// isolation convention as tests/release-blockers.js.
