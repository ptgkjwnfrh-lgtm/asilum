// Found by the Aug 8 codebase audit. Two constitution-class defects sat in the
// LIVE OBSERVATION feature, both in the "no faking" family:
//
//   1. app/page.js told the user "observed interest in <tag> ON AN EXTERNAL
//      TAB". ASILUM has no cross-site observation capability anywhere, and
//      /privacy tells the user — correctly — "no cross-site tracking". The
//      home page claimed a surveillance power the product does not have while
//      the privacy page denied doing it. The tags actually come from
//      GET /api/profile: the user's own in-app taste vector.
//   2. The ON-DEVICE TASTE OBSERVATION switch was decorative. observationOn()
//      was read only to render the module and the toggle; nothing gated the
//      dwell and examination sends. Turning it OFF hid a panel while passive
//      attention data kept flowing, under copy promising "the brain only
//      learns from explicit actions".
//
// These are source-level guards because both defects are CLAIMS, and a claim
// regresses by someone retyping it, not by a function returning the wrong
// number. Same shape as tests/sign-out-notice.test.js.
