// to primary makes SECOND-DEVICE sign-in the normal case: both sides hold real
// taste. mergeTasteProfiles was written for the other case — device into an
// EMPTY account — and handled the two branches inconsistently:
//
//   tag on ONE side  -> kept at FULL strength
//   tag on BOTH sides -> AVERAGED
//
// so weak corroborating evidence was punished harder than no evidence at all.
// MEASURED on the real adoption path before the fix: an account at TAILORED 0.8
// signing in on a barely-used device holding TAILORED 0.1 came out at 0.45 —
// the account's strongest conviction nearly halved — while that same device's
// GORP 0.9, a tag the account had never expressed, arrived untouched at 0.9.
//
// The fix weights each side by evidence mass (interaction count, sqrt-damped),
// which makes ABSENCE the limit of PRESENCE rather than a separate rule. These
// tests state the criteria the merge is now declared to meet. They drive the
// REAL adoption path in mem-mode, not mergeTasteProfiles directly, so the
// mass-must-be-counted-before-the-rows-move ordering is under test too.
