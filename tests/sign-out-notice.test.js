// row and reassigns its boards, interactions and follows to the account,
// leaving the device at {} / [] / [] — and corrected a sign-out notice that
// claimed "device taste remains".
//
// It corrected ONE of the two emitters. app/profile/page.js has its own SIGN
// OUT handler publishing the same notice and still carried the false string,
// so both fired on sign-out and raced; whichever landed last is what the user
// read. A grep for the phrase would have caught it and was never run.
//
// These tests are that grep, made permanent. The point is not the wording — it
// is that a claim measured to be false cannot come back by being retyped
// somewhere the fix did not look.
