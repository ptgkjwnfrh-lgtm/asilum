// REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH ON A LISTING — and the one temptation it must refuse.
//
// A dhash is a DUPLICATE DETECTOR. At hamming ≤6 it means "the same
// photograph". At 10, 14, 20 it means nothing reliable — two dark garments on
// a white background land close together whether or not they resemble each
// other. The obvious "improvement" to this module is to widen the threshold and
// call the results similar, and that would be a guess wearing a feature's
// clothes. Most of these tests exist to stop it.
