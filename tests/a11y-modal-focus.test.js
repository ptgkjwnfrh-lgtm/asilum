// tests/a11y-modal-focus.test.js — aria-modal is a promise, and it must be kept.
//
// `aria-modal="true"` tells assistive technology that everything behind the
// dialog is inert. The attribute does not MAKE that true — it only asserts it.
//
// The item detail declared it while: focus stayed on the trigger BEHIND the
// layer when the dialog opened, 200 focusable elements behind remained
// tabbable, and nothing was inert. A keyboard user opening a piece kept focus
// in the catalog and could tab through a page they could no longer see, while a
// screen-reader user was told the opposite. Verified with real clicks and real
// Tab presses, not simulated events.
//
// `useFocusTrap` (app/components/dismiss.js) is what keeps the promise: focus
// moves in on open, Tab cycles inside, and focus is RESTORED to whatever opened
// the dialog on close. Escape still closes it (useEscape), so this is not a
// trap the user cannot leave — that would be WCAG 2.1.2.
//
// Focus behaviour cannot be asserted from source. What CAN be asserted, and is
// the thing that actually regressed, is the PAIRING: nothing may claim
// aria-modal without being wired to the trap.
