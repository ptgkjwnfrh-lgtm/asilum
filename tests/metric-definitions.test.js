// tests/metric-definitions.test.js — a number the site prints must mean what
// its label says, and must not exist when nothing measures it.
//
// The Aug-17 audit found the same shape of bug the accessibility and SEO queues
// kept finding: a claim the code did not keep. Here the claim is a LABEL. Four
// examples, all live before this file existed:
//
//   * /cover printed "undefined INTERACTIONS · undefined READERS · undefined
//     BOARDS · undefined GRAPH EDGES" one line above its own colophon claim
//     that "EVERY VALUE ON THIS PAGE IS REAL STATE", and told every visitor
//     "STATE — MEMORY MODE" on a deployment running Postgres.
//   * /stylist printed a 75–99 ranking display with a "%" after it.
//   * /stylist printed CURATED, TASTE and MATCH as three differently-labelled
//     copies of one number for model-built looks.
//   * /profile printed "0 FOLLOWERS" for a quantity no code anywhere measures,
//     and counted bag brands under a label sitting beside FOLLOWING.
//
// The authority is docs/metric-definitions-2026-08-17.md. These tests are that
// document made executable.
//
// The source-reading tests here are bound (`[^)]*`, `[^<]*`, single lines) on
// purpose — an earlier structural guard in this repo used `[\s\S]*?`, matched an
// unrelated token fifteen lines away, and stayed green under revert.
