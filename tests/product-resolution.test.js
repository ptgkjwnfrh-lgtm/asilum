// tests/product-resolution.test.js — audit finding #10, verified in
// docs/audit-verified-2026-08-14.md.
//
// resolveProducts awaited resolveProduct once per id, so a 60-id
// /api/interaction request became 60 primary-key queries — against the shipped
// max:5 pool that is 12 sequential round-trip waves, each holding every
// connection while it waited — plus a fallback pool probe for every id that
// missed. It is now one `id = ANY(...)` scan and at most one probe.
//
// The COUNT is asserted in tests/postgres-integration.test.js, deliberately:
// in mem, resolution is an O(1) Map hit per id either way, so a mem assertion
// could not tell the two implementations apart. What mem CAN prove is that
// batching did not change any answer, and that is what these tests are for.
