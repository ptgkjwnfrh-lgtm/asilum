// tests/opengraph-image.test.js — the social card is drawn from the real tokens
// and says what the page says.
//
// Satori resolves no CSS variables and reads no stylesheet, so
// app/opengraph-image.js hardcodes five colours. That is a second copy of the
// design language, and this repo has already watched a palette move twice in two
// days for contrast (#216 moved --sig, #218/#219 moved --red and --p2). A copy
// nothing checks is a copy that goes stale, so these tests READ app/globals.css
// and fail if the card and the stylesheet disagree — the same discipline as
// tests/theme-contrast.test.js, which recomputes its ratios from the stylesheet
// rather than trusting a number written down next to them.
//
// The card was also verified as a real artifact, not just as source: served from
// a running server it returns `content-type: image/png`, a valid PNG signature,
// and 1200x630 read out of the IHDR chunk.
