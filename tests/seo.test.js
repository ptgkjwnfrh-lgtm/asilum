// The catalog is a demo: every piece is a synthetic sample record, not real
// inventory (owner ruling, #212), and the page says so in a red-bordered banner.
// Search metadata is the same promise made to a machine, so it is held to the
// same standard. See docs/seo-notes.md for the reasoning; these tests are that
// document made executable.
//
// The sharpest rule here is a NEGATIVE one: no Product JSON-LD. Structured
// product data is what puts a price and an availability into a search result and
// into Google Shopping. Every product on this site is fabricated, so emitting it
// would push invented prices into a shopping index — and unlike a labelled page,
// a rich result carries no banner explaining itself.
